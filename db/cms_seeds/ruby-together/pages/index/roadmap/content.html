  <p>Today, Ruby Together is committed to improving the three most widely-used core Ruby tools:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Bundler</b>, the Ruby dependency manager, used by every Ruby project to manage and install gems</li>
    <li><b>RubyGems</b>, the code that makes it possible to create gems in the first place</li>
    <li><b>RubyGems.org</b>, the website that provides free hosting for public gems</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <p>As time and funding permits, the Ruby Together team will:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Roll out a <a href="http://andre.arko.net/2014/03/28/the-new-rubygems-index-format/">new gem index</a> that will make installing gems two to ten times faster than today</li>
    <li>Migrate all of RubyGems.org to the <a href="http://fastly.com">Fastly CDN</a>, providing dramatic speed improvements when downloading gems and gem data</li>
    <li>Build a gem caching server to easily allow data centers and offices to cache local copies of the gems they need, whether public or private</li>
    <li>Improve <a href="http://rubygems.org">RubyGems.org</a>, adding search, statistics, and more gem information to every page</li>
  </ul>

  <p>And there will be more! We start new projects based on community need and Ruby Together's available funding.</p>
